## Project 4 — Extras (Order 4)

This folder contains optional projects to try after completing the core three. If you want to run multiple services on one Pi, discuss Dockerization with Robby. 🔧

Optional projects:

- Media server: Jellyfin (self-hosted streaming)
- Nextcloud (personal cloud)
- Homebridge (HomeKit bridging)

Media server quick-start (Jellyfin)
- Use Raspberry Pi Imager to flash Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS and follow Jellyfin's Linux/arm instructions: https://jellyfin.org/docs/
- Use an external USB drive for media storage (recommended for durability).

Notes on single-app-per-device
- For simplicity and stability, run only one main service on a Pi for a beginner (Home Assistant OR BirdNET-PI OR Pi-hole). Running several services requires Docker and more troubleshooting; Robby can assist remotely. 🔧
