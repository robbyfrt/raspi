### Contributing Bird Audio to Cornell Lab of Ornithology

Cornell hosts several projects that accept bird audio, including the Macaulay Library and eBird. Steps to contribute:

1) **Review policies** - Check Macaulay Library contribution guidelines and licensing. Some projects require metadata (location, date/time, recorder).

2) **Prepare recordings** - Pick representative clips where a bird is clearly audible. Trim to useful segments.

3) **Upload process** - Create an account on the Macaulay Library (https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/). Follow their upload interface to submit audio files and metadata.

4) **Automation possibility** - For automated contributions, consider manual review before uploading. Robby can help create a pipeline to filter high-confidence BirdNET detections and prepare uploads.

5) **Data privacy** - As with weather data, sharing location may reveal private information. Choose coordinate precision accordingly.
