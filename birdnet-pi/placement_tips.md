### Microphone placement tips

The goal is to maximize bird audio capture while reducing steady background noise (traffic, stream). The Boya BY-M1S lapel mic with the UGREEN USB dongle works well; consider a small windshield for outdoor exposure.

1) **Height and direction** - Place the mic at the balcony edge, slightly elevated and pointing toward trees or green space rather than directly at the stream or street.

2) **Shielding and wind protection** - Use a foam or furry windshield ("dead cat") to cut wind noise from the stream.

3) **Distance from noise sources** - Move the mic as far away from constant sources (AC vents, busy roads) as practical.

4) **Test and iterate** - Run a 24–48 hour test and review false positives; reposition and repeat.

5) P**ower and cabling** - Use short, high-quality USB cables; keep connectors sheltered and dry.

6) **Legal and privacy** - Do not point the mic at private neighbor areas or record conversations. 🔧
